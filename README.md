# Dice_Roller 
This is my pet project recomeded by Google
I am learning Android using (mainly) courses from developer.android.com
I want to notice, that site and lessons are pretty nice, at first time when you are newbie in android, thta site looks like not so good, littile bit hard and the site looks like a labiringth :D
at first time it was hard to reOpen my courses and find them in the site, but then I started to undestand aeverything about android that i saw in  the site
so, its nice for newbies, and this pet project is the easiest one of my project. i am sure that i will develop things much better and much interesting than this pet project.
for now its is 
see ya
